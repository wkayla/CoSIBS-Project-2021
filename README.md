Assessing changes in metabolites across time between healthy controls and children diagnosed with CAP./n

## Merging Analytic Files /n

Notes I things I wanted the group to notice and think through:/n
•	The study IDs for the case and control samples were the same and needed to be manipulated to be distinct/n
o	This was pointed out by Nathan/n
•	The metabolites raw data had a section at the bottom with text that when read in would cause issues in merging/n
•	The column names for the cases and controls were different and in order to merge samples together needed to be manipulated/n
•	The timepoint labels were different for cases and controls/n
o	Not only were the timepoints different there was white space causing issues in grouping/n
