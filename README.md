## Background

Assessing changes in metabolites across time between healthy controls and children diagnosed with CAP.

## Merging Analytic Files 

Notes I things I wanted the group to notice and think through:

•	The study IDs for the case and control samples were the same and needed to be manipulated to be distinct

  - This was pointed out by Nathan

•	The metabolites raw data had a section at the bottom with text that when read in would cause issues in merging

•	The column names for the cases and controls were different and in order to merge samples together needed to be manipulated

•	The timepoint labels were different for cases and controls

  - Not only were the timepoints different there was white space causing issues in grouping
