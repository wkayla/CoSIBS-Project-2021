# CoSIBS-Project-2021

## Background
In the summer of 2021 I was a mentor for students enrolled in the Colorado Summer Institute in Biostatistics hosted by the University of Colorado Anschutz. The projects my students and I were working on was attempting to assess changes in metabolites over time between healthy controls and children diagnosed with community aquired pneumonia (CAP). This repo served as notes for my students and I.

## Merging Analytic Files 

Notes I things I wanted the group to notice and think through:

•	The study IDs for the case and control samples were the same and needed to be manipulated to be distinct

  - This was pointed out by Nathan

•	The metabolites raw data had a section at the bottom with text that when read in would cause issues in merging

•	The column names for the cases and controls were different and in order to merge samples together needed to be manipulated

•	The timepoint labels were different for cases and controls

  - Not only were the timepoints different there was white space causing issues in grouping
