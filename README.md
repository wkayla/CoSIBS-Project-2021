# CoSIBS-Project-2021

## Background
In the summer of 2021 I was a mentor for students enrolled in the Colorado Summer Institute in Biostatistics hosted by the University of Colorado Anschutz. The project my students and I were working on was attempting to assess changes in metabolites over time between healthy controls and children diagnosed with community aquired pneumonia (CAP). This repo served as notes for my students and I.
